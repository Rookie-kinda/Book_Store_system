# Book_Store_system
This is a simple Book store management systems that keeps track of all the books in the library, can edit, remove, or add the books and their information

This is supposed to take in a some books with some information (all listed in the "books1.csv" file.
This then can allow a customer to buy book(s) and keep track of how much they cost them in EGPs.
It can also keep track of what books are in there with their information, I will update more on this code with time, but feel free to add on it and do a pull req
This is my first ever big real project using OOP concepts and pandas, I've written this over 8-9 months ago, but I'm only recently uploading it on github.
Feel free to play with this code for a little while, trying it, or, if you do run a small book store you can use this, although do contact me if that's the case because it will then need some edits on it to suite you, or just to add some more functionality to it that i've been thinking about anyways.
